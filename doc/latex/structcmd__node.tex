\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Structure representing a command node.

\-Such a node contains a token accepted to enter the node (or {\ttfamily \-N\-U\-L\-L} if there is no token needed), a documentation string to present the user, a function to validate the user input (or {\ttfamily \-N\-U\-L\-L} if no function is needed) and a function to execute when entering the node. \-Because we can enter a node just by completing, the execution part should have no other effect than modifying the environment, with the exception of execution on {\ttfamily \-N\-E\-W\-L\-I\-N\-E} (which cannot happen when completing). 

\-The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
