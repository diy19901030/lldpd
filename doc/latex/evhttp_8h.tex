\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-An http implementation subsystem for \-Libevent.

\-The $<$\doxyref{evhttp.\-h}{p.}{evhttp_8h}$>$ header is deprecated in \-Libevent 2.\-0 and later; please use $<$\doxyref{event2/http.\-h}{p.}{http_8h}$>$ instead. \-Depending on what functionality you need, you may also want to include more of the other $<$event2/...$>$ headers.
