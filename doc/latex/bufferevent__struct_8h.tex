\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Data structures for bufferevents. \-Using these structures may hurt forward compatibility with later versions of \-Libevent\-: be careful!

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{\-Deprecated}
\item[{\bf \-Deprecated}]\-Use of \doxyref{bufferevent\-\_\-struct.\-h}{p.}{bufferevent__struct_8h} is completely deprecated; these structures are only exposed for backward compatibility with programs written before \-Libevent 2.\-0 that used them. \end{DoxyRefDesc}
