\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-A dns subsystem for \-Libevent.

\-The $<$\doxyref{evdns.\-h}{p.}{evdns_8h}$>$ header is deprecated in \-Libevent 2.\-0 and later; please use $<$event2/evdns.\-h$>$ instead. \-Depending on what functionality you need, you may also want to include more of the other $<$event2/...$>$ headers.
