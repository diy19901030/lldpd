# lldpd
A few weeks ago, a new version of lldpd, a 802.1AB (aka LLDP) implementation for various Unices, has been released.  LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as EDP or CDP. The goal of LLDP is to provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver Link-Layer notifications to adjacent network devices.
